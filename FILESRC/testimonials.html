          <h4>How has implementing Woody's training program affected your life?</h4>
          <p>“When we started I struggled to walk up a flight of stairs or walk a brisk mile. Now I’m energized, even after a long day. I’m able to manage my health issues because training has forced me to take better care of myself. To top it off I’m happier. Working out is my mental health break. I may come in tried, grumpy, upset and by the end my mind is clear, ready to move forward.”</p>

What you need to bring is your commitment to the process. ” </p>
